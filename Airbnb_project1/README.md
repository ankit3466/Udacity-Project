# An analysis of Boston's Airbnb market

## Context
I've chosen this dataset to understand which areas in Boston are better for tourists and what makes a highly rated Airbnb host. Using Pyhon (numpy, pandas, sklearn, and seaborn) I produced results for these questions and published them in a Medium article here(https://medium.com/@ankitgupta_/analysis-of-bostons-airbnb-market-596c9694e4d5)

## Content 

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

I chose the Boston Airbnb Dataset to understand:

**1. What areas are the most expensive and busy areas to stay in Boston?**
**2. Are certain neighborhoods more expensive than others, and by how much?**
**3. Are certain neighborhoods busier at different times of the year?**
